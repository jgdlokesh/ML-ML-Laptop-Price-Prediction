Project Title
Laptop Price Prediction

Introduction
Provide a brief introduction to the project, its purpose, and its scope.

Description:
This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features such as brand, specifications, and other attributes using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a predictive model that can help consumers and businesses estimate laptop prices accurately.

Motivation:
With the rapid advancement in technology, the laptop market is constantly evolving. Having a reliable price prediction model can assist buyers in making informed decisions and help sellers price their products competitively.

Dataset:
Attached in Github.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Gathering the dataset from reliable sources.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers, feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of data and relationships between features.
Model Building: Choosing and training machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
Model Evaluation: Using metrics like RMSE, MAE, R² score to evaluate model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model for better performance.

Results:
The final model achieved an R² score of XX on the test set, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual laptop prices. The most influential features were identified as Processor Type, RAM, and Brand.

Conclusion:
This project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict laptop prices with high accuracy. Future work could involve incorporating more features, using advanced algorithms, and applying the model to different regions and time periods.
